# GeoCapture

GeoCapture is a two step authentication Android app which uses the user's environment as the first layer of security for unloacking the phone. The image of the environment is stored in the application and is mapped to the GPS location. While unloacking the phone the image features are matched with the stored images and the corresponding GPS coordinates.
